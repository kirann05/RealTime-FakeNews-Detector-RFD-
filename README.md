### Environment Setup and Library Installations
- **Library Installations**: Your notebook starts with the installation of several Python libraries crucial for handling various aspects of data processing and machine learning. These include:
  - `sentence-transformers` and `transformers` for leveraging state-of-the-art NLP models.
  - `seqeval` for evaluating the model's performance on sequence labeling.
  - `Datasets` and `accelerate` for efficient loading and processing of large datasets.
  - Specified versions of `tensorflow`, `pandas`, `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio` to ensure compatibility and functionality of the tools used.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Loading**: You load data from specified paths, which are divided into training, testing, and development datasets. This organization supports a robust evaluation setup.
- **Text Cleaning**: A function named `clean_tweet` is used to preprocess tweets by:
  - Removing URLs and mentions to focus on relevant text.
  - Stripping punctuation and converting text to lowercase to standardize the input for NLP models.
- **Application of Cleaning Function**: This function is applied to clean the text columns across all datasets, preparing the data for further analysis and modeling.

### Model Evaluation
- **Evaluation Setup**: The environment for evaluating your model is configured, which includes loading the trained model and preparing the data loader.
- **Data Collection**: During evaluation, the code collects true labels and predicted probabilities from the model, which are essential for performance metrics.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **ROC Curve Plotting**: ROC curves are plotted for each class to assess the model's discriminative ability, a critical aspect of model performance in classification tasks.
  - **Binarization of Labels**: The labels are binarized for ROC analysis, helping in the computation of metrics like AUC (Area Under the Curve).

### Additional Utility Functions
- **Plotting Text Length Histogram**: A utility function to plot histograms of text lengths in the dataset, providing insights into the distribution of tweet lengths and helping in understanding the preprocessing impact.

### Comments on Code Organization and Suggestions
- **Documentation**: Each significant step is well-documented through comments, aiding in understanding and maintaining the code.
- **Modular Design**: Functions like `clean_tweet` encapsulate specific functionalities, promoting reusability and cleaner code.

### Future Improvements and Considerations
- **Error Handling**: Adding robust error handling around data loading and processing can make the code more reliable.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Consider exposing parameters in the `clean_tweet` function for more flexible preprocessing, such as an option to keep or remove hashtags.
- **Performance Optimization**: For large datasets, optimizing data loading and processing through techniques like multiprocessing or more efficient data structures could be beneficial.
- **Expand Model Evaluation**: Enhance model evaluation metrics to include confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1 scores for a more comprehensive performance assessment.

 ## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Real-Time Fake News Detection system, which integrates advanced machine learning techniques with Natural Language Inference (NLI) to detect and categorize misinformation on social media platforms. The goal is to provide users with tools to discern truthfulness in real-time, enhancing the integrity of information spread across digital spaces.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implements BERT and SBERT models for dynamic content analysis.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Users can configure alerts based on specific misinformation patterns.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## System Architecture
The system is designed with the following components:
- **Data Acquisition**: Automated scripts to fetch and preprocess data from diverse sources.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes pretrained BERT and SBERT for natural language processing tasks.
- **User Interface**: Streamlit dashboard for interaction and real-time alerts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy
- Bidirectional Encoder Representations(BERT)
- Sentence BERT

## Usage
Launch the Streamlit dashboard to analyze and monitor news content. Enter URLs or text snippets for analysis, and the system will assess and display the credibility score based on trained models.
