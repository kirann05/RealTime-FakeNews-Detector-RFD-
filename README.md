 ## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Real-Time Fake News Detection system, which integrates advanced machine learning techniques with Natural Language Inference (NLI) to detect and categorize misinformation on social media platforms. The goal is to provide users with tools to discern truthfulness in real-time, enhancing the integrity of information spread across digital spaces.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implements BERT and SBERT models for dynamic content analysis.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Users can configure alerts based on specific misinformation patterns.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## System Architecture
The system is designed with the following components:
- **Data Acquisition**: Automated scripts to fetch and preprocess data from diverse sources.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes pretrained BERT and SBERT for natural language processing tasks.
- **User Interface**: Streamlit dashboard for interaction and real-time alerts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy
- Bidirectional Encoder Representations(BERT)
- Sentence BERT

## Usage
Launch the Streamlit dashboard to analyze and monitor news content. Enter URLs or text snippets for analysis, and the system will assess and display the credibility score based on trained models.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the functionality or improve the accuracy of the detection models are welcome. Please see the issues tab to report bugs or suggest enhancements.
